                    Raw Dataset on embodied carbon:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are using the Embodied Carbon
                    Benchmark Study by Carbon Leadership Forum (LCA for Low Carbon Study, Part One, 2017) that includes
                    data on Research
                    Database Building Characteristics and LCA Parameters. The LCA data includes stage A and B for most
                    datapoints. Detailed
                    documentation on the study can be found here: <a
                        href="https://carbonleadershipforum.org/embodied-carbon-benchmark-study-1/"
                        target="_blank">https://carbonleadershipforum.org/embodied-carbon-benchmark-study-1/</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The limitations we faced were the lack of material type and quantities, mentioned as "Of note, while
                    the primary
                    structural material type was collected in the confidential database, this information is not
                    included in the research
                    database."
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, we studied the basic principles that helped us assign structural category against each
                    data point. We
                    identified four main types of structural types:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Wood
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wood-Concrete Hybrid (20 % concrete & 80 % wood in material quantities, while 38% concrete & 62%
                        wood in embodied carbon
                        calculation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reinforced - Concrete
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Steel-concrete (20 % steel & 80 % concrete in material quantities, while 77% steel & 23%
                        concrete in embodied carbon
                        calculation)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The basis of assigning structural types are as follows:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If TCO2 is more than 300 and floor is between 1-6 - it is an RC building, else is Wood
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If building is more than 25 floors and more than 1000 TC02 its a steel concrete, otherwise its a
                        concrete building
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If TCO2 is more than 250 and floor is between 1-6 - it is an Wood Hybrid
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If 400TCO2 is 7-14 floors, then we have RC structure
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If more than 25 and below 300 TCO2, its RC
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Data distribution:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are some embedded biases in the dataset. For example there are more samples for medium-size
                    buildings with lower
                    carbon footprint. Therefore the predictions will be better for this scale. However the input data
                    are not very
                    correlated so the models are able to learn and not overfit.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    Model A:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Scenario A includes a regression model which predicts the CO2 emissions based on the total area,
                    number of floors,
                    location, construction type and type of building. As we can see on the graphs, the model is able to
                    learn this
                    relationship reaching a mean squared error of 0.016.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    Model B:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Scenario B includes a classification model which predicts the class of the construction type of the
                    building based on
                    the target CO2 emissions, the building type, the total area, the number of floors and the location.
                    As we can see on the
                    graphs, the model is able to learn the relationship reaching accuracy of 94%.

                    Rhino-Plugin - Flask Server:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We have linked a user-friendly Rhino plugin built with WPF in c# to a live flask server that calls a
                    trained ML model to
                    query the user parameters and display the desired information in the backend. Since this tool
                    utilizes a flask server,
                    we can host this on a cloud server to enable the possibility to scale the product. In addition, this
                    tool can run
                    entirely in the background where the user would only need to have a valid Rhino 7 license to empower
                    their design
                    decisions within the context of climate change and LEARN ABOUT CARBON!
